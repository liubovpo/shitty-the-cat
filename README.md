## Backlog

- [x] ~~Increasing speed~~: The speed of obstacles currently increases with time and it's represented by the game's level number.

- [x] ~~Sound Effects~~: Implemented sound effects to enhance the gaming experience. That includes sounds for jumping, collecting food, start and game-over.

- [x] ~~Jumping and Eating Animation~~: Engaging animations for the cat character, including jumping animations when avoiding obstacles and an eating animation when collecting food items, have been successfully implemented.

- [x] ~~Simple User Interface and Clear Instructions~~: An intuitive user interface (UI) has been designed and implemented, featuring the display of the player's score, level, exit and sound buttons. Clear instructions have been provided to assist players in understanding the game mechanics.

#### To Be Done:

- [ ] **Different Environments**: Add variety to the game by introducing different environments or backgrounds. Each environment can present unique challenges and aesthetics.

- [ ] **Advanced Animations**: Enhance the visual appeal of the game by incorporating advanced animations for character movements, obstacles, and special effects.

- [ ] **Bigger Variety of Obstacles**: Introduce a wider range of obstacles to keep the gameplay engaging and unpredictable. Different obstacles can have distinct behaviors and require varied strategies to overcome.
